# Robotics Project
A collection of the research project at Gifu University focusing on robotics as a branch of Artificial Intelligence. This was for the duration there following a JASSO scholarship for 3 months

The research presents the application of the 5 DOF open-link robots (ROT3U) inshape drawing tasks as enhanced by visual feedback from image processing.

The approach used employed Edge detection to identify the boundaries of objects within the workspace image by employing the Hough Transform mathematical model to detect the abrupt changes in the image brightness pixel-wise. The pixel locations from Hough were then sorted sequentially to outline the detected object. The integration of image processing with the robotic tasks was expected to improve the precise detection of the position of objects as well as the outline of geometric shapes.
